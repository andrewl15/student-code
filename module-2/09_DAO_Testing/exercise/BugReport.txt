Test that demonstrates problem:

getTimesheetsByEmployeeId_with_valid_employee_id_returns_list_of_timesheets_for_employee
Expected output:

getTimesheetsByEmployeeId(1) should return a list of size 2
Actual output:

getTimesheetsByEmployeeId returns a list of timesheets of size 1
How did you fix this bug?

in the try the if(result.next()) only reads the first input and then stops
it should be a while loop: while (results.next()) {
                                           Timesheet timesheet = mapRowToTimesheet(results);
                                           timesheets.add(timesheet);
                                       }
